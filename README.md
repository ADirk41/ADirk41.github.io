# ADirk41's Home Page!
## About This Page
I made this page mainly for the Web Development Class I'm in, although if I wind up remembering, and am able to, I might end up transfering ownership of this repository to a personal account... once I make one for myself, that is.
## Handly Little Webdev Cheatsheet Section
### Markdown Script
```markdown
<!-- This is a comment. Anything inside this won't render in the README. -->
# A single hashtag makes the largest heading text! (A first-level heading)
###### Six hashtags make the smallest heading text! (A sixth-level heading)
~~No need to get complicated!~~
*A single asterisk or underline on either side makes italic text. Note: both must be the same symbol!*
**A pair of asterisks or underlines on both sides of some text make bold text. Same case for bold text as italic text**
**You can have _italic_ text inside bold text!**
_The opposite **works** as well._
***This is bold and italic text at the same time.***
> this is quoted text!
Triple backticks make multiline code, single backticks make inline code.

+ Unordered Lists
+ look like this!

1. Ordered lists
2. use numbers!
3. To make nested lists...
   - ...make sure the dash lines up with the first character in the list spot above it!

- [ ] I am...
- [X] ...the task manager!

> [!NOTE]
> Make some notes for mildly important information for users!

> [!TIP]
> A good README provides guides and tips on how something is to be used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to use this for conveying critically important things!

> [!WARNING]
> Without warnings, users won't know what to do if something goes wrong.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't throw caution to the wind, or users might cause serious damage if your code can cause harm!

Unsurprisingly, there will be cases where you'll need to escape some characters. Like this:

\`\`\`
This would normally render as multiline code!
But it doesn't! HOORAY!!!
\'\'\'
```
### Visual Result (...except for the headers and multiline/inline code parts)
